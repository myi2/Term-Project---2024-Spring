# The Big Idea
We aim to develop a Python-based web scraper that collects real estate listings from various websites. By inputting search criteria such as location, price range, and desirable home features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage), users will receive tailored home recommendations. Our minimum viable product (MVP) will provide a straightforward list of homes that match the specified criteria, while our stretch goals include creating a user-friendly web interface and integrating with mapping APIs for enhanced location-based searches.

# Learning Objectives
1. **Primary Objective:** Learn to construct and deploy a Python-based web scraper that can navigate and extract data from real estate websites efficiently.
2. **Secondary Objective:** Acquire skills in data cleaning and manipulation to organize the scraped data into a user-friendly format.
3. **Tertiary Objective:** Investigate machine learning algorithms for recommending homes based on user preferences and historical data.

# Implementation Plan
- Explore Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium for web scraping capabilities.
- Design a robust data model to store and manipulate the scraped data effectively.
- Identify and evaluate real estate websites that permit scraping and contain the necessary data.
- Develop the scraping logic to systematically extract home listings based on the user-input criteria.
- Implement a filtering algorithm to sort and present the most relevant home recommendations.
- *(For stretch goals)* Design a simple web interface using Flask or Django, allowing users to input their criteria and view recommendations effortlessly.

# Project Schedule
- **Week 1-2:** Select the most suitable Python libraries for web scraping and initiate scraping from a single real estate website.
- **Week 3:** Expand our scraping capabilities to include multiple sources and commence work on the data model.
- **Week 4:** Develop the logic for filtering and recommending homes to users.
- **Week 5:** *(Stretch Goal)* Begin the development of a web interface.
- **Week 6:** Focus on testing, resolving any bugs, and final preparations for our presentation.

# Collaboration Plan
We plan to divide the workload based on individual interests and skill sets while scheduling pair programming sessions for more challenging tasks. We'll use GitHub for version control and task management, ensuring clear communication through Slack or another chosen platform.

# Risks and Limitations
- Potential changes in website layouts or anti-scraping measures may necessitate frequent updates to our scraping logic.
- Efficiently managing and processing a large volume of data could present a significant challenge.
- We must consider legal and ethical aspects of web scraping, especially regarding compliance with website terms of service and user data privacy.

# Additional Course Content
- Advanced Python programming techniques for effective web scraping.
- Techniques for data storage and manipulation, possibly involving an introduction to databases.
- Fundamentals of machine learning algorithms for creating recommendation systems.

This project will not only enhance our Python programming abilities but also introduce us to the realms of data science and web development. We'll ensure to verify the legality of scraping our chosen websites, adhere to robots.txt files, and contemplate the ethical implications of our project. We're excited to embark on this journey and are open to further guidance as we progress!
